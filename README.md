Humans are able to overcome sensory perturbations imposed on their movements through motor learning. One of the key mechanisms to accom- plish this is sensorimotor adaptation, an implicit, error-driven learning me- chanism. Past work on sensorimotor adaptation focused mainly on adapta- tion to rotated visual feedback—A paradigm known as visuomotor rotation. Recent studies have shown that sensorimotor adaptation can also occur under mirror-reversed visual feedback. In visuomotor rotation, sensorimotor adap- tation can be driven by both endpoint and online feedback [1] [2]. However, it’s not been clear whether both kinds of feedback can similarly drive adapta- tion under a mirror reversed perturbation. We performed a study to establish what kinds of feedback can drive adaptation under mirror reversal. In the first two conditions, the participants were asked to ignore visual feedback. In the first condition, we provided mirror reversed online feedback and end- point feedback. We reproduced previous findings showing that online feed- back elicited adaptation under mirror reversal. In a second condition, we provided mirror reversed endpoint feedback. However, in the second condi- tion, we found that endpoint feedback alone failed to elicit adaptation. In a third condition, we provided both types of feedback at the same time, but in a conflicting way: endpoint feedback was non-reversed while online feedback was mirror reversed. The participants were asked to ignore online visual feedback and try to hit the target with help from veridical endpoint feedback. In the third condition, in which veridical endpoint feedback and mirror re- versed online feedback were provided, adaptation still occurred. Our results showed that endpoint feedback did not elicit adaptation under mirror rever- sal but online feedback did. This dissociation between effects of endpoint feedback and online feedback on adaptation under mirror reversal suggests that adaptation under these different kinds of feedback might in fact operate via distinct mechanisms.
